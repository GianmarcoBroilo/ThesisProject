# ThesisProject

The thesis project studies the contribution of stellar occultations combined with VLBI spacecraft tracking observables to estimate the state of Jupiter and its Moons. The covariance matrix of the estimation is then propagated and the formal uncertainties in RSW of Jupiter and the moons are extracted. Two main cases are studied: the stellar occultation of Callisto (15.01.2024) combined with the VLBI tracking of JUNO and the combination of stellar occultations of Io (02.04.2021) Europa (22.06.2020) combined again with VLBI tracking of JUNO.
